# Blockchain Smart Contract
This project implements safe and secure Smart Contract, and also implements designs in the source code to ensure secure transactions, a core element in Smart Contract. The program features include:
+ Send money safely
+ Authenticate transaction
+ Prevent transaction fraud and faked transaction
+ Prevent transaction attack using cryptographic schemes
+ Sign transactions using ECDSA

In addition, the project also covers the mechanism and detection of a common type of attack in Smart Contract: Reentrancy Attack, apply Smart Contract to programming fighting games, training a Deep Learning model to detect Smart Contract vulnerabilities.
## Technology
+ Solidity
+ OpenZeppelin
+ Ganache, RemixIDE, MetaMask
## Usage
You can use RemixIDE web version (or install) to run the "smart_contract.sol" file in the "scripts" folder, and can deploy the Smart Contract on MetaMask - a Chrome (or other browser) extension.
